Title: A Unified Framework for Random Forest Prediction Error Estimation
Version: 1.1.0.9000
Author: Benjamin Lu and Johanna Hardin
Maintainer: Benjamin Lu <b.lu@berkeley.edu>
Description: Estimates the conditional error distributions of random forest
    predictions and common parameters of those distributions, including
    conditional mean squared prediction errors, conditional biases, 
    conditional quantiles, and conditional misclassification rates, by
    out-of-bag weighting of out-of-bag prediction errors as proposed by Lu and
    Hardin (2021). This package is compatible with several existing packages
    that implement random forests in R.
