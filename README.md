### Version 1.1.0.9000 Update

Version 1.1.0.9000 compartmentalizes a costly step in the `quantForestError` algorithm: The identification of each training observation's out-of-bag terminal nodes.

By isolating this step from the main `quantForestError` function, Version 1.1.0.9000 allows users to more efficiently iterate the algorithm. Users may wish to feed `quantForestError` batches of test observations iteratively if they have streaming data or a large test set that cannot be processed in one go due to memory constraints. In previous versions, doing so would require the algorithm to recompute each training observation's out-of-bag terminal nodes in each iteration. This was redundant and costly. By separating this computation from the rest of the `quantForestError` algorithm, Version 1.1.0.9000 allows the user to perform this computation only once.

As part of this modularization, the `quantForestError` function now has two additional arguments. If set to `TRUE`, `return_train_nodes` will return a `data.table` identifying each training observation's out-of-bag terminal nodes. This `data.table` can then be fed back into `quantForestError` via the argument `train_nodes` to avoid the redundant recomputation.

Version 1.1.0.9000 also exports the function that produces the `data.table` identifying each training observation's out-of-bag terminal nodes. It is called `findOOBErrors`. Assuming the same inputs, `findOOBErrors` will produce the same output that is returned by setting `return_train_nodes` to `TRUE` in the `quantForestError` function.

See the documentation on `quantForestError` and `findOOBErrors` for examples.

These changes should not affect code that relied on Version 1.0.0 of this package, as they consist solely of a newly exported function and two optional arguments to `quantForestError` that by default do nothing new.

### Overview

The `forestError` package estimates conditional mean squared prediction errors, conditional biases, conditional prediction intervals, and conditional error distributions for random forest predictions using the plug-in method introduced in Lu and Hardin (2021). These estimates are conditional on the test observations' predictor values, accounting for possible response heterogeneity, random forest prediction bias, and random forest prediction variability across the predictor space.

In its current state, the main function in this package accepts regression random forests built using any of the following packages:

- `randomForest`,
- `randomForestSRC`,
- `ranger`, and
- `quantregForest`.

### Installation

Running the following line of code in `R` will install a stable version of this package from CRAN:

```{r}
install.packages("forestError")
```

To install the developer version of this package from Github, run the following lines of code in `R`:

```{r}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github(repo = "benjilu/forestError")
```  

### Instructions
See the documentation for detailed information on how to use this package. A portion of the example given in the documentation is reproduced below for convenience.

```{r}
# load data
data(airquality)

# remove observations with missing predictor variable values
airquality <- airquality[complete.cases(airquality), ]

# get number of observations and the response column index
n <- nrow(airquality)
response.col <- 1

# split data into training and test sets
train.ind <- sample(1:n, n * 0.9, replace = FALSE)
Xtrain <- airquality[train.ind, -response.col]
Ytrain <- airquality[train.ind, response.col]
Xtest <- airquality[-train.ind, -response.col]
Ytest <- airquality[-train.ind, response.col]

# fit random forest to the training data
rf <- randomForest::randomForest(Xtrain, Ytrain, nodesize = 5,
                                 ntree = 500, keep.inbag = TRUE)

# estimate conditional mean squared prediction errors, conditional
# biases, conditional prediction intervals, and conditional error
# distribution functions for the test observations
output <- quantForestError(rf, Xtrain, Xtest, alpha = 0.05)
```
